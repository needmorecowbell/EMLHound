## Inspiration

I started this project after I started taking interest in the unusual messages arriving to my spam folder. I wanted to see if I could find any relationships between the emails I received.


These are some of the cool projects I found along the way:

- https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope
- https://github.com/cyberdefenders/email-header-analyzer
- https://github.com/ninoseki/eml_analyzer

These are some of the projects I've worked on in the past that helped me make this project:

- https://github.com/InQuest/ThreatIngestor
- https://github.com/needmorecowbell/Funnel
